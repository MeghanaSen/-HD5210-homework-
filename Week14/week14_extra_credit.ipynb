It also offered a set of various visualization options, adapted for different types of data and explained them clearly. While it did not directly give datasets or links to the data relevant to my project, it contributed more. Responses were logical and in the line with my needs; however, actionable steps about handling errors, comparing model performances, and selecting proper visualizations are still pending. Overall responses made sense, but more directness with regard to dataset sources/links was expected."
